# KPMG-VI-Project

# Project Description:

The project involves analyzing three datasets - Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transaction data from the past three months - provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a client of KPMG. The client is looking to boost their business by analyzing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behavior. The objective is to recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization. The analysis will involve three phases - Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. A PowerPoint presentation will be prepared to outline the approach for each phase and to present the results to the client. A dashboard will also be developed to display the data summary and results of the analysis.

# Project Objective:

The main objective of the project is to analyze the provided datasets and recommend which of the 1000 new customers Sprocket Central Pty Ltd should target to drive the most value for the organization. The analysis will also identify trends in the underlying data, customer segments with the highest customer value, and propose a marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. Additionally, the presentation will propose external datasets that may be useful in obtaining greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products. The project will involve the following steps: understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting. The analysis will be presented to the client in a detailed plan, PowerPoint presentation, and dashboard format.
